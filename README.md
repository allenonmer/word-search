Word Search Puzzle is a fun and easy-to-use puzzle game built based on web technologies. The goal in this game is to make words with random alphabets on the screen. Simply draw a line where you think there could be a meaningful word. If it was a correct guess, the word will be marked and you will get points for that. There are three levels to choose from (easy, normal and hard) and over 2000 words to select. The game has seven categories to play which you can choose from the home screen.
